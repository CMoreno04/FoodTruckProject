## Lessons Learned

### -Use printf to format average display to desired decimal position, in this case %.1f formatted the final average.

### -All Fields and Methods inside FoodTruckApp where instantiated as private, for the exception of main. In addition, Fields where made also private in FoodTruck Class and FoodTruckLot.

### -Scanner .nextLine() needed for String input to allow spaces in Name and Type. Also, a blank Scanner .nextLine() had to be implemented right after a int or Double Scanner input, this to prevent interference with the following String Scanner input.
