# Food Truck Project

## Week 2 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

## Overview

### Users will input and rate a preferred number of food trucks. Furthermore, if the user would like to change the desired number of trucks, "Quit" can be inputed when asked for a name to exit the prompt. Subsequently, the user will select from a menu that will give the options to view a list of all trucks, the average rating, the highest-rated truck or exit the program. 

## Technologies/Topics Applied

### Arrays
### do/while Loops
### For each loops
### For loops
### Encapsulation
### Constructors
### Object Instantiation
### Printf Formatting



## Lessons Learned

### -Use printf to format average display to desired decimal position, in this case %.1f formatted the final average.

### -All Fields and Methods inside FoodTruckApp where instantiated as private, for the exception of main. In addition, Fields where made also private in FoodTruck Class and FoodTruckLot.

### -Scanner .nextLine() needed for String input to allow spaces in Name and Type. Also, a blank Scanner .nextLine() had to be implemented right after a int or Double Scanner input, this to prevent interference with the following String Scanner input.
